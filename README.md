Pegasus is a simple, menu‑driven Python tool that helps you work with Android devices via **ADB**.  
It’s perfect for beginners who want a clean interface to: check device info, connect over Wi‑Fi, take screenshots, record the screen, mirror the display (via **scrcpy**), and list installed APKs.

## ⚙️ Requirements
**On PC (Linux or Windows):**
- Python **3.8+**
- **ADB** (Android Debug Bridge)
- **scrcpy** *(optional, only for screen mirroring)*
- `git` *(to clone the repo)*

**On Android phone:**
- Developer options **enabled**
- **USB debugging** turned on
- For Wi‑Fi ADB: phone and PC must be on the **same network**

---

## 📱 Phone Setup (Android)
1. Open **Settings** → **About phone** → tap **Build number** 7 times to enable **Developer options**.  
2. Go to **Settings** → **Developer options** → enable **USB debugging**.  
3. Connect the phone to PC via **USB cable** and **Allow** the RSA fingerprint prompt.  
4. *(For Wi‑Fi ADB)* Ensure **phone and PC are on the same Wi‑Fi**. Find phone IP:  
   - Wi‑Fi details page (IP address), **or**  
   - After USB connection:  
     ```bash
     adb shell ip addr show wlan0 | grep 'inet '
     ```

---

## 🐧 Linux Setup (Kali/Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
# Core tools
sudo apt install -y adb scrcpy python3 python3-venv git

# (Recommended) Udev rules so device works without sudo
sudo apt install -y android-sdk-platform-tools-common
```

> If `scrcpy` is not needed, you may skip it. Everything else is required.

## scrcpy Installation  

Since `sudo apt install scrcpy` may not work on some systems, please follow the official installation guide:  

👉 [scrcpy Installation for Linux](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/doc/linux.md)


## 🪟 Windows Setup (Optional)
- Install **Android Platform Tools** (ADB) from Google or via **winget**:
  ```powershell
  winget install --id Google.PlatformTools
  ```
- Install **scrcpy** (optional) from releases or via **winget**:
  ```powershell
  winget install Genymobile.scrcpy
  ```
- Install **Python 3** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure **Add to PATH** is checked.
- Open **Command Prompt / PowerShell** in the project folder to run the script.

---

## ⬇️ Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thakur2309/PAGASUS-PRO.git
cd PAGASUS-PRO
# Place your script here as: pegasus.py
```

*(If your file name is different, adjust commands accordingly.)*

---

## ▶️ Run Pegasus
```bash
python3 pegasus.py
```
If you see the Pegasus banner and the menu, you’re good to go.

---

## 🧭 How to Use (Step by Step)
1. **Connect via USB** and authorize the device on first use.  
2. Launch Pegasus: `python3 pegasus.py`.  
3. Start with **[1] Check Device** to verify connection and view info.  
4. To use **Wi‑Fi ADB**:  
   - Keep USB connected once, choose **[2] Connect a Device**.  
   - Script will switch ADB to TCP/IP on **port 5555** and ask for your **phone’s IP**.  
   - Enter IP (example: `192.168.1.42`) → it will run `adb connect <ip>:5555`.  
   - You can now disconnect USB and continue **wirelessly**.  
5. Use other options as needed (record screen, mirror, screenshot, list APKs, etc.).  
6. When done, choose **[3] Disconnect Device** or simply close the program.

---

## 🧰 Menu Options Explained
- **[1] Check Device**  
  Shows connected device list and prints **Model**, **Android version**, and **Battery** level.

- **[2] Connect a Device (Wi‑Fi ADB)**  
  Puts ADB in TCP/IP mode (`adb tcpip 5555`) and connects to the phone at `<IP>:5555`.

- **[3] Disconnect Device**  
  Runs `adb disconnect` to close all ADB over‑network sessions.

- **[4] Screen Recording**  
  Prompts for duration (in seconds), records using:
  ```bash
  adb shell screenrecord --time-limit <secs> /sdcard/record.mp4
  adb pull /sdcard/record.mp4 ./
  ```
  Saves file as `./record.mp4` locally.

- **[5] Screen Mirror (scrcpy)**  
  Opens **scrcpy** to mirror and control your phone on the desktop. *(Requires `scrcpy` installed.)*

- **[6] Show APK List**  
  Lists installed packages with paths:
  ```bash
  adb shell pm list packages -f
  ```
  Optionally saves to `apk_list.txt`.

- **[ ] Take Screenshot → **[7]**  
  Captures and pulls a screenshot:
  ```bash
  adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screen.png
  adb pull /sdcard/screen.png ./
  ```

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting
- **Device not detected**
  - Use a good USB cable and port.
  - Run:
    ```bash
    adb kill-server
    adb start-server
    adb devices
    ```
  - Accept the **Allow USB debugging** prompt on phone.
  - On Linux, install udev rules: `sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common` and replug the device.

- **`adb connect <ip>:5555` fails**
  - Ensure phone & PC are on the **same network**.
  - Re‑enable TCP/IP: `adb tcpip 5555` (over USB) and try again.
  - Verify IP is correct from Wi‑Fi details.

- **`scrcpy` not found**
  - Since `sudo apt install scrcpy` may not work on some systems, please follow the official installation guide:  

👉 [scrcpy Installation Guide for Linux](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/doc/linux.md)
 - **`scrcpy` not found in windows**
   - `winget install Genymobile.scrcpy` (Windows).

- **Permission denied / file not pulled**
  - Ensure storage permission if prompted on device.
  - Try alternative paths like `/sdcard/Download/`.

## ❓ FAQ
**Q: Does Pegasus require root?**  
A: **No**, ADB + Developer Options are enough.

**Q: Will this hack devices?**  
A: **No**. Pegasus is a utility around ADB for legitimate debugging, automation, and learning.

**Q: Can I use Pegasus wirelessly without USB every time?**  
A: After the first USB authorization + `adb tcpip 5555`, you can connect over Wi‑Fi using `adb connect <ip>:5555` (until the phone restarts or IP changes).

**Q: Where are the files saved?**  
A: In the **current working directory** (e.g., `record.mp4`, `screen.png`, `apk_list.txt`).
